1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A hidden folder called git is created within the repository which stores the git metadata.  Git init does
		not automatically create a commit of your repository.  You need to add the files that you want to track 
		and	make your own commit.  
	You need to do it to use git tracking.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It holds only the files from the working directory that you want to commit.
	It allows you to logically decide how to commit files.  Some should be committed together, while others should
		remain separate.
